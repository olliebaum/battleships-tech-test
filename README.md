# Battleship tech test
Week 10 Makers Academy.  

The task is to create a battleships game with a command line interface according to [this spec](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/battleships_tech_test.md).  

# My plan
I aim to build this project in Node.js (even though I am less familiar with developing CLI in Node). I want to test my app with jest as I have had success using jest in the past, and it provide nice clear readout.
